## Question

### Part 1

- Create a new class A.
- Create another class B that extends A.
- Play with the access modifiers (slide 22) to make sure you understand them.
- Add an instance field to A and initialize it with some value (inside the constructor).
- Add the same instance field to B initialize it with a different value.
- Create a new class C with the main method. Create an instance of B in the main method. Print out the value of the instance field.

### Part 2

- Add a method to A that prints out "I'm of type A".
- Add a method with the same signature to B that prints out "I'm of type B".
- Create an instance of B in the main method class C. Call the method you declared in A and print the value.
- How can LJou get your program to print both "I'm of type A" and "I'm of type B"?
- Make the methods static and see what happens. Note that you should call the method  on the class name.
